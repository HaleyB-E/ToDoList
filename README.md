<h1 id="markdown-header-composable-analytics-front-end-design-test">Front-End Design Exercise</h1>

<p>This repository contains a front-end for a simple Web-based to-do list app. To run it, just open <code>todo.html</code> in a Web browser.  Since this is just a test for front-end engineers, there's no back-end and all data is lost when the user closes their browser window.</p>
<p>The user can create, delete, and edit tasks, and check them off when they're done. Tasks can be nested within other tasks. In addition, the user interface enforces the following rule: if a task is checked off, then all its subtasks are also checked off.</p>

<p>Your assignment is to make this application more visually appealing and more usable, to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>At the very least, you will need to write a CSS stylesheet, as the app currently doesn't have one. You may also modify or rewrite the HTML and/or JavaScript code if doing so helps improve usability. (The existing JavaScript code is designed to be reasonably robust to changes in the structure of the HTML, provided that the existing element identifiers and classes are left alone and not used for any new elements.)</p>
<p>You may use any open source frameworks or libraries that you like.  (The existing code uses only vanilla JavaScript.)</p>
<p>The app must render properly and run without bugs in the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.  (If you're not running Windows 10, you can download a virtual machine with Microsoft Edge <a href="https://dev.modern.ie/tools/vms/windows/">here</a> and use it for testing.) Other browsers need not be supported.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
